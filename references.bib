@article{BowlingMichael2002Mlua,
	abstract = {Learning to act in a multiagent environment is a difficult problem since the normal definition of an optimal policy no longer applies. The optimal policy at any moment depends on the policies of the other agents. This creates a situation of learning a moving target. Previous learning algorithms have one of two shortcomings depending on their approach. They either converge to a policy that may not be optimal against the specific opponents' policies, or they may not converge at all. In this article we examine this learning problem in the framework of stochastic games. We look at a number of previous learning algorithms showing how they fail at one of the above criteria. We then contribute a new reinforcement learning technique using a variable learning rate to overcome these shortcomings. Specifically, we introduce the WoLF principle, ``Win or Learn Fast'', for varying the learning rate. We examine this technique theoretically, proving convergence in self-play on a restricted class of iterated matrix games. We also present empirical results on a variety of more general stochastic games, in situations of self-play and otherwise, demonstrating the wide applicability of this method.},

	abstract = {If two species have an identical `ecology', (way of life), & if they are put together in the same geographical region, one species will necessarily extinguish the other, no matter how small the diff in their competitive abilities. Ecological differentiation is the necessary condition for coexistence. This principle, generally knwn as 'Gause's principle', is shown to have been used by various biologists long before Gause (1934). Grinnell (1904) clearly stated it, & Darwin (1859) used it implicitly in discussing evolution. Essentially it is one axiom in a whole conceptual scheme relating to pop dynamics, & cannot be proved or disproved by itself; the entire scheme must be tested for its adequacy. Rechristening the idea as the 'competitive exclusion principle', (Hardin, 1959) it is shown that Bertrand made use of it in economics in 1883, to deal with the competition of entrepreneurs. Suggestions are made of its present-day relevance to rugged individualism, fair trade laws, labor unions, patent & copyright laws, & tariffs. It is postulated that the principle is not as widely known or as generally employed as it should be because of the psychol'al denial process provoked by an unconscious fear of its practical implications. Comments from readers & further discussion occur in Science, 132, 3419, 8 Jul, 96. AA.},

	abstract = {A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.},

	abstract = {The concept of an agent has become important in both artificial intelligence (AT) and mainstream computer science. Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.},
